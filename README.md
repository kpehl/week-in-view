## Description

  A CMS-style web page where users have a homepage that shows them a weekly calendar where they can add, edit, and delete events as well as see a to-do list. Users can view previous and upcoming weeks as well, focus on a given day or see the whole month, giving a concise visual representation of a userâ€™s schedule without losing details or a broader view.. This application is an example of the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the passport npm package for authentication.
